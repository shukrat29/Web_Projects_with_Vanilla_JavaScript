# Vanilla JavaScript Projects

Welcome to my collection of web projects built using **vanilla JavaScript**! This repository showcases a variety of applications and interactive features that demonstrate my skills in front-end development without relying on frameworks or libraries. Each project highlights different aspects of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, focusing on clean code, responsiveness, and user experience.
